# spbu-ai-fundamentals
Materials for the practicum for "AI Fundamentals" course  at SpbU

## Practicum 1

We study basic tools necessary for the rest of the course: python, numpy, matplotlib and pandas. It is assumed that a student has some decent knowledge of python though he/she is not very experienced in it.

## Practicum 2

We continue studying pandas and get familiar with data preprocessing techniques (filtering, imputing etc.).

## Practicum 3

We study the scikit-learn architecture.

## Practicum 4

We make use of scikit-learn classes for data preprocessing.

## Practicum 5

We study basic techniques for feature engineering (encoding of categorial features) and feature selection (variance threshold).

## Practicum 6

We study linear models for regression and classification problems.

## Practicum 7

We continue studying logistic regression and introduce decision trees.

## Practicum 8

We continue studying decision trees and also get familiar with kNN for classification and regression problems.

## Practicum 9

We study clustering algorithms including k-means and DBSCAN.

## Practicum 10

We study probabilistic inference exemplified by Bayesian networks.
